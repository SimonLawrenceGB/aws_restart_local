# Python Fact Finding Exercise

## Define a list and tuple in Python

### Lists

> A list is one of the major Python data structures used to contain a set list of things called items. Like arrays, list to tuple Python helps keep similar types of data values together, condensing their code together. This helps perform several detailed operations on multiple values at the same time. For example, a folder of songs on your desktop has different other subfolders adjusted following different genres for a hassle-free collection. List to tuple Python is used to improve efficiency and help the system manage all the values together.

### Tuples

> Just like lists, tuples also contain a set of objects in an ordered manner. These objects are kept separated by commas. Tuples are immutable and do not allow the entrance of additional objects once a tuple is created. Tuples are incapable of expanding or making modifications; therefore, they differ from lists. Removing elements is also not possible from tuples which restrict its collection. The immutability often serves as an advantage in delivering faster, efficient results.

> While the major purpose and foundation of tuple vs. list Python are the same, various methods differentiate the two.

## What is a namespace in Python?

> A namespace is a collection of currently defined symbolic names along with information about the object that each name references. You can think of a namespace as a dictionary in which the keys are the object names and the values are the objects themselves. Each key-value pair maps a name to its corresponding object.

## What is the difference between a local variable and a global variable?

### Local Variable

> A Local Variable is defined as a type of variable declared within programming block or subroutines. It can only be used inside the subroutine or code block in which it is declared. The local variable exists until the block of the function is under execution. After that, it will be destroyed automatically.

### Global Variable

> A Global Variable in the program is a variable defined outside the subroutine or function. It has a global scope means it holds its value throughout the lifetime of the program. Hence, it can be accessed throughout the program by any function defined within the program, unless it is shadowed.

## What is an IDE?

> An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Just as writers use text editors and accountants use spreadsheets, software developers use IDEs to make their job easier.

**Some IDE that can be used with Python are:**

- Visual Studio Code
- PyCharm
- Cloud9
- Atom

## What are modules in Python?

> In Python, Modules are simply files with the “. py” extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions that you want to include in your application.

## What is the difference between an array and a list?

### A List

- Can consist of elements belonging to different data types
- No need to explicitly import a module for the declaration
- Cannot directly handle arithmetic operations
- Preferred for a shorter sequence of data items
- Greater flexibility allows easy modification (addition, deletion) of data
- The entire list can be printed without any explicit looping
- Consume larger memory for easy addition of elements
- Nested lists can be of variable size

### An Array

- Only consists of elements belonging to the same data type
- Need to explicitly import the array module for declaration
- Can directly handle arithmetic operations
- Preferred for a longer sequence of data items
- Less flexibility since addition, and deletion has to be done element-wise
- A loop has to be formed to print or access the components of the array
- Comparatively more compact in memory size
- Nested arrays has to be of same size

## What are operators?

> An operator, in computer programming, is a symbol that usually represents an action or process. These symbols were adapted from mathematics and logic. An operator is capable of manipulating a certain value or operand.

> Operators are the backbone of any program and they are used for everything from very simple functions like counting to complex algorithms like security encryption.
