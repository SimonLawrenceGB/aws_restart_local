## What does Jenkins do?

Jenkins is an **open source automation server**. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, deploying, facilitating continuous integration, and continuous delivery.
It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. It supports version control tools like Git, Mercurial, Perforce, ClearCase, and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven, and sbt based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.

## Why is this important?

This is crucial because it streamlines development processes, reduces manual errors, and ensures that software is always ready for deployment. It saves time and resources and increases the overall quality of software.

## Jenkins and Mergify

Jenkins combined with Mergify is able to fully utilise Jenkins robust build & test automation with Mergify's github workflow automation (labeling, merging, backporting) creating a powerful CI pipeline

Automation aids developers in complex repetitive tasks allowing them to allocate their time to more complex tasks of higher importance
